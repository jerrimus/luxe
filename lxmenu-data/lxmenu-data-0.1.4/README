This package provides files required to build freedesktop.org 
menu spec-compliant desktop menus for LXDE.

The files are originally taken from gnome-menus, and some minor
modifications were made.

lxmenu-data package is required by lxpanel and lxlauncher.

For package maintainers, please use the following configure options:
./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc

Default menu file should be put into /etc/xdg/menus according to the spec.
If you put it into /usr/etc/xdg/menus, nothing will work.
So, please make sure that lxde-applications.menu is installed in /etc/xdg/menus.
